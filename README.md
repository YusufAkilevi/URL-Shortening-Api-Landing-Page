### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS

- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I practiced async Javascript with using url shortening api and responsive web desing with using CSS

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - This website explains css properties really easy to understand and provide example codes.
